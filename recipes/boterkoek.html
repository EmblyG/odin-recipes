    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A classic Dutch recipe for boterkoek, a buttery and almond flavoured snacking
         cake typically eaten with coffee as a mid-morning treat. The sliced 
         almond topping can be arranged into a floral design for a more elegant look. </p>
    <p>This recipe comes from a handwritten card passed down from my grandmother. 
        The original recipe contained no instructions, only a list of ingredients and
        a baking temperature. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp almond extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>sliced almonds and addiitional egg for topping, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease or non-stick spray a round cake pan. </li>
        <li>In a stand mixer or with a handhold beater, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed.</li>
        <li>Add in the egg and almond extract. Continue to beat on medium speed until just combined. </li>
        <li>Add in flour and baking powder and mix on low until just combined. Dough should be thick, similar to cookie dough. </li>
        <li>Press dough into prepared cakepan, ensuring it covers the entire bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Optionally, distribute a single layer of sliced almonds across the top of the cake and gently press into the surface.
             Beat an egg with 1 tsp of cold water to create an egg wash and brush over the top of the cake</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown on the edges.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool, then slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
