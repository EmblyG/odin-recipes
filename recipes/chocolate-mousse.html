    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This wonderfully rich whipped chocolate mousse is the basis of many cool summery desserts. Use it as the filling of a
         no bake pie, as frosting or filling on any cake, or simply on its own
        with some berries and whipped cream.</p>
    <p>This recipe is adapted from the filling of  Sally's Baking Addictions <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/dark-chocolate-mousse-cake/">Dark Chocolate Mousse Cake </a> </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup hot water(I use the hottest water my kitchen tap will provide)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>200g chopped dark chocolate- equivalent of 2 dark chocolate bars</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream, chilled</li>
        <li>Optionally, if using as a cake frosting: 2 Tablespoon powdered sugar AND 1 Tablespoon Instant Clear Jel, for stiffness  </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a microwave safe bowl, carefully melt the chopped chocolate in the microwave. The safest way to do so 
            is using lower power settings on your microwave and short increments. For example, I set my microwave to half power and 
            45 second intervals, stirring well between each interval, until the chocolate is fully melted. </li>
        <li>Whisk together the hot water and cocoa powder then add to the melted chocolate stirring until completly combined. </li>
        <li>In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment or a hand mixer, beat heavy cream until medium peaks form. </li>
        <li>Optionally, if using as a frosting for a cake: Sift together powdered sugar and Instant Clear Jel and add to the heavy cream just before peaks start to form. This will create a stiffer mousse that will withstand being used as frosting. </li>
        <li>Pour the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream and fold it in until combined </li>
        <li>Refrigerate overnight to set</li>
    </ol>
